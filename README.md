# Midjourney history sync

As of August 2022, Midjourney's multi-downloader did not include exact
prompts, flags, or other metadata. This is my attempt to provide a
stop-gap measure. It downloads any new images (since the last time you
ran it) along with their complete metadata.

**This requires familiarity with HTTP and the command line.** See
sync.sh for details.

I cannot provide support; if you want a supported option, please ask
Midjourney.
