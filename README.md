# Midjourney history sync

As of August 2022, Midjourney did not provide a way to back up all of the images you had generated complete with exact prompts, flags, and other metadata. This is my attempt to provide a stop-gap measure. It downloads any new images (since the last time you ran it) along with their metadata.

**This requires familiarity with HTTP and the command line.** See sync.sh for details.

I cannot provide support; if you want a supported option, please ask Midjourney.
